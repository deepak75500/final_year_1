MYSQL AND MONGODB PROJECT:
Using natural language, an intelligent, user-friendly
system is suggested to make interacting with SQL and NoSQL
databases easier. The system makes it simple for both technical
and non-technical users to access and analyse data by doing
away with the need for complicated setup and manual query
writing. Along with guaranteeing safe, optimal performance, it
also addresses integration issues across platforms like Python
and JavaScript. It also facilitates the integration of
people-centric data from HRMS and CRMs, giving businesses
the ability to learn about trends, behaviour, and satisfaction. The
solution seeks to improve usability, data accessibility, and
well-informed decision-making in a number of fields.
